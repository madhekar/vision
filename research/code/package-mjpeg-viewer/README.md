# Display up to 16 MJPEG streams

[![Import](https://cdn.infobeamer.com/s/img/import.png)](https://info-beamer.com/use?url=https://github.com/info-beamer/package-mjpeg-viewer)

This package can be used to display MJPEG streams generated by a lot of IP-connected
cameras like those from [Axis](https://www.axis.com/products/network-cameras).

You can add multiple camera urls to show multiple cameras at once. Right now the
limit is 16 cameras. Cameras are always aligned in a 2x2, 3x3 or 4x4 grid.

If you use four or more cameras, it's recommended to limit the capture size as
well as the framerate to reasonable values so all camera images can be realistically
updated fast enough by the Pi. For Axis cameras you can use urls like the
following to control framerate and resolution:

```
/axis-cgi/mjpg/video.cgi?resolution=cif&fps=5
```

You can specify an HTTP username/password per camera if your camera is password
protected. Both BasicAuth and DigestAuth authentication schemes are supported.

Each camera can have a name that is visible in the bottom left corner of each
image.

Usually the text in the corner should show **Live**. This means that the image
shown is up-to-date. If the streaming process couldn't update the image
for a few seconds, the text instead reads **Last updated ..s ago**. info-beamer
will automatically try to reconnect to cameras after a few seconds.

## Privacy

An info-beamer device usually doesn't store the retrieved images, although
retrieved images are temporarily stored in the filesystem. The info-beamer
operating system is configured so it doesn't immediately persist written
data and images are constantly overwritten by newer versions. This usually
means that images are not persisted at all and only kept in the filesystem
cache. In a future update, a RAM disk might be used to completely avoid
storing the images at all.

The captured images are visible on the device detail page in the
live view. This captured screen output isn't stored by info-beamer hosted.

## Automation

info-beamer hosted has a [powerful API](https://info-beamer.com/doc/api). It
allows you to automate almost every action on our platform. Here's how you
can use this feature to automate this package.

### Switching to different camera

If you have cameras you want to switch to during the night, you can automate
this. The easiest way is to create two different setups: One configured for
all the day-time cameras and another one for the night-time camera. With just
using the web dashboard you can then easily switch between them by assigning
them to a device. With the API you can of course automated this.

Let's say your setups have the IDs `12345` and `23456` and you want to switch
between those on a device with ID `4567`. Here is a `curl` based command line
you can use:

```
# Switch device 4567 to setup 12345
curl -u:$API_KEY https://info-beamer.com/api/v1/device/4567 -d setup_id=12345

# Switch device 4567 to setup 23456
curl -u:$API_KEY https://info-beamer.com/api/v1/device/4567 -d setup_id=23456
```
