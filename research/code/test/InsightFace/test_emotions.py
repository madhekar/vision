Emotion Classification (using landmarks).
InsightFace primarily focuses on face detection, recognition, and alignment. While it provides accurate facial landmarks, it does not directly offer a built-in emotion classification module based on these landmarks. To perform emotion analysis using the extracted landmarks, you would typically:

    Train a custom model:
    Use the extracted landmark coordinates as features to train a machine learning model (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, or a small neural network) on a dataset labeled with emotions (e.g., FER-2013, AffectNet). The input to this model would be the normalized landmark coordinates or features derived from them (e.g., distances between specific landmarks, angles).
    Utilize another library:
    Integrate with a specialized emotion recognition library that can take facial landmarks as input or use the full face image for emotion classification. Libraries like DeepFace or Py-Feat are examples of tools that offer emotion analysis capabilities. 

Example (Conceptual - using another library like DeepFace for emotion):

 # This is a conceptual example, as DeepFace takes the image directly,
    # but demonstrates how you might combine tools if DeepFace offered landmark-based input.
    # For actual DeepFace usage, you would pass the image directly.

    # import deepface
    # analysis = DeepFace.analyze(img_path = 'path/to/your/image.jpg', actions = ['emotion'])
    # print(analysis)

Example (Conceptual - training a custom model):
 # This is a conceptual outline for training a model
    # 1. Collect a dataset of images with emotion labels.
    # 2. For each image, use InsightFace to extract landmarks.
    # 3. Preprocess landmarks (e.g., normalize, compute feature vectors).
    # 4. Train a classifier (e.g., RandomForestClassifier, MLPClassifier) on these features.
    # 5. Save the trained classifier.

    # When inferring:
    # loaded_classifier = load_your_trained_model('path/to/model.pkl')
    # landmarks = face.kps
    # preprocessed_features = preprocess_landmarks(landmarks)
    # predicted_emotion = loaded_classifier.predict(preprocessed_features)
    # print(f"Predicted emotion: {predicted_emotion}")
