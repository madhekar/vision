The following solution worked for me:

    boot to a Ubuntu Live DVD/USB (Use this guide to make an Ubuntu Live DVD/USB) and start gparted; 
    then determine which /dev/sdaX is your Ubuntu EXT4 partition and quit gparted
    open a terminal window type sudo fsck -f /dev/sda4 replacing 4 with the number you found earlier 
    -- repeat the fsck command if there were errors --
    type reboot


sudo fsck -nf /dev/nvme0n1p7

The
UnicodeDecodeError with pipreqs occurs when it encounters a file with an encoding other than the expected UTF-8. The best solutions involve either specifying the correct encoding with a command-line flag or ignoring directories that contain problematic, non-UTF-8 files (like virtual environment folders). 
Solutions

    Specify the encoding (Recommended): If your project uses a different consistent encoding, you can tell pipreqs to use it with the --encoding flag. A common alternative on Windows is 'ISO-8859-1' or 'windows-1252'.
    bash

    pipreqs --encoding=ISO-8859-1 /path/to/project

    You may need to experiment to find the correct encoding.
    Ignore problematic directories: The error often occurs in virtual environment directories (.venv, env, etc.) which contain non-Python files or files with different encodings. You can use the --ignore flag to skip these.
    bash

    pipreqs /path/to/project --ignore .venv,env

    This approach is highly effective and recommended by users on GitHub.
    Identify and fix the file: If you can locate the specific file causing the error (the error message usually provides the position, which can help narrow it down), you can open it in a text editor (like VS Code, Notepad++) and change its encoding to UTF-8 and save it.
        On Linux/macOS, you can use file -i <filename> or file -I <filename> to try and identify the file's current encoding.
    Move code to a new folder: As a last resort, you can create a new, clean folder, move only your source code files into it (leaving out hidden environment folders), and run pipreqs from that new location.

Streamlit recursively monitors changes in the parent folder of the application script, e.g. app.py [source].

The idea is that if source files update, the app is 'rerun', as a convenience for app development. However, if this folder contains too many subfolders and subfiles, apparently watchdog reaches a limit and raises an error. This easily happens if you run straight from your home directory, which contains tons of configuration files, etc. Or maybe when you run from a git repository with numerous files in .git (just speculating).

You can resolve this by either placing the app.py script in a (sub)folder than only contains dependencies that you'll edit during development, or by --server.fileWatcherType none and accept the nuisance of manually restarting.

streamlit run app.py --server.fileWatcherType none
