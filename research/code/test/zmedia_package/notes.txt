The configuration error
project.scripts.run-zm-app must be a python-entrypoint-reference indicates an issue in your pyproject.toml file, likely within the [project.scripts] section. This setting requires a specific format that points to a callable function within a Python module, not just a script name or file path. 
How to Fix the Error
To resolve this, modify the entry in your pyproject.toml file to follow the correct format: "module_name:function_name". 

    Ensure your script has a main function: In the Python file that acts as your entry point (e.g., run_zm_app.py), ensure you have a dedicated function (commonly named main()) that you want the script to execute.
    python

    # In your_module/run_zm_app.py

    def main():
        # Your Streamlit app logic goes here
        import streamlit as st
        st.set_page_config(page_title="My App", layout="wide")
        # ... rest of your app code

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()

    Update pyproject.toml: Change the value associated with run-zm-app in the [project.scripts] section to reference the module and function correctly.
        Incorrect:
        toml

        [project.scripts]
        run-zm-app = "run_zm_app.py" # Or just "run-zm-app"

        Correct:
        toml

        [project.scripts]
        run-zm-app = "your_module.run_zm_app:main"

    Replace your_module with the actual importable name of the package/module containing the run_zm_app.py file. If the file is at the root of your source directory and is importable as run_zm_app, the reference would be "run_zm_app:main". 

Key Considerations

    Format: The standard format is importable.module:callable.
    Module Structure: The system expects to be able to import your code as a Python module (e.g., import your_module.run_zm_app). If your project structure uses a src directory, make sure your build system (like setuptools or Poetry) is configured to include it properly, and your entry point reference reflects that (e.g., "src.your_module.run_zm_app:main", or just "your_module.run_zm_app:main" if configured to find the module inside src).
    Rebuild and Reinstall: After changing pyproject.toml, you must rebuild and reinstall your project (often using pip install . or pip install --editable .) for the changes to take effect in your environment.
