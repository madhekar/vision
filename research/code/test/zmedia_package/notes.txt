I think I solved this, at least for my machine. Lone_Wolf's suggestion about the fast boot possibly being an issue got me to poking around my bios a bit more. Under "Advanced CPU" I found another boot setting called "Boot performance mode" that was set to "Turbo" - what exactly that means I don't know. The little info box says that "Boot Performance Mode" is used to "Select the performance state that the BIOS will set before OS handoff" - again, not really clear what that means.

However, switching it from "Turbo" to "Max Non-Turbo Performance" has (so far) solved this problem. Not sure if it's just a coincidence and this will crop up again, but so far after several reboots I haven't had the described issue occur again. It's still not clear to me why this issue started all of the sudden, as I haven't made any changes to my bios settings in many months.

If anyone has any insight to what these settings are actually doing I'd be interested to know (brief googling hasn't turned up much). Asus Z87 Pro mobo, if that's relevant.
