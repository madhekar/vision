This guide will help you easily install ROCm, ZLUDA, and Blender on Linux Mint 21.3.
It can be executed on a fresh installation, but it might also work after an apt update
and upgrade (i've not tested for edge iso kernels of mint so far).

Installation of ROCm

The compatible version with the current ZLUDA 3
is ROCm 5.7.0. Hereâ€™s how to proceed:

Create the directory for APT keys:

sudo mkdir --parents --mode=0755 /etc/apt/keyrings

Download and add the ROCm GPG key:

wget https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/rocm.gpg.key -O - | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/rocm.gpg > /dev/null

Add the ROCm and AMDGPU repositories:

sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/amdgpu.list <<'EOF'
deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/rocm.gpg] https://repo.radeon.com/amdgpu/5.7/ubuntu jammy main
EOF

sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm.list <<'EOF'
deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/rocm.gpg] https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/5.7 jammy main
EOF

Set the package priority:

echo -e 'Package: *\nPin: release o=repo.radeon.com\nPin-Priority: 600' | sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/rocm-pin-600

Update and install the necessary packages:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install amdgpu-dkms
sudo apt install rocm-hip-libraries
sudo reboot

After rebooting, install other ROCm packages:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rocm-dkms rocm-dev hip-base hip-doc hip-samples hip-runtime-amd

Update the environment variables:

export PATH=$PATH:/opt/rocm/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/rocm/lib

Add the user to the video and render groups:

sudo usermod -a -G video $USER
sudo usermod -a -G render $USER
sudo reboot

Verify if ROCm is running:

/opt/rocm/bin/rocminfo
/opt/rocm/opencl/bin/clinfo

Installation of ZLUDA

Download the compiled binaries of ZLUDA 3:

https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA/releases ... nux.tar.gz

Extract the files into a local folder in your home directory:

tar -xvf zluda-3-linux.tar.gz -C /home/<username>/mybin/zluda-lib

Installation of Blender

Download Blender (version 4.0 recommended):

You can download an alternative version of Blender
called Bforartists, which is based on Blender 4.0:

https://www.bforartists.de/data/binarie ... -Linux.deb

Install the .deb package:

sudo dpkg -i bforartists-3.6.2-Linux.deb

If you prefer to use the .tgz tarball, download it from the official Blender website and extract it.

Note: Blender 4.1.1 or later versions may not work and could give an error
in the rendering window. Everything has been tested with Blender 4.0 or
variants based on it, like Bforartists 3.6.2.

Using Blender with ZLUDA

Add the Blender command with ZLUDA to your .bashrc:

echo 'alias blender="LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/<username>/<local-bin>/zluda-lib bforartists"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

Now you can start Blender with the command:

blender

Configure Blender to use your GPU:
Open Blender.
Go to Edit -> Preferences.
In the Preferences window, select the System tab.
Under CUDA, select your GPU.
Deselect your Radeon GPU under HIP (as it is no longer needed).
When you load a file to render, go to the camera icon in the Properties panel.
Under Render Engine, select Cycles and then choose GPU Compute.
