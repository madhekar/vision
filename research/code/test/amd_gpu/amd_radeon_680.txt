The AMD Radeon 680M is an integrated graphics solution, not ideal for demanding deep learning tasks. While it can handle some basic AI-related computations, it lacks the dedicated hardware and software support found in high-end GPUs optimized for deep learning. NVIDIA GPUs are generally preferred for deep learning due to better software and driver support, including CUDA and cuDNN. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Hardware Limitations:

Lack of Tensor Cores:
The Radeon 680M does not have specialized hardware like tensor cores, which are crucial for accelerating deep learning computations like matrix multiplications. 

Limited Memory:
Integrated graphics share system memory, which can be a bottleneck for large deep learning models and datasets. 

Software and Driver Support:

NVIDIA's CUDA and cuDNN:
NVIDIA provides robust software and driver support for deep learning through CUDA (a parallel computing platform) and cuDNN (a library of optimized CUDA functions).

AMD's ROCm:
While AMD has ROCm (Radeon Open Compute platform), it is not as widely adopted or optimized as CUDA, and many deep learning frameworks lack full ROCm support.

Limited Ecosystem:
The deep learning ecosystem is heavily skewed towards NVIDIA, with most libraries and tools primarily optimized for CUDA. 

Performance Considerations:

Not Optimized for Deep Learning:
The Radeon 680M is designed for general-purpose computing and gaming, not for the specific needs of deep learning.

Slower Performance:
Due to the lack of hardware acceleration and software support, the Radeon 680M will likely perform much slower than NVIDIA GPUs specifically designed for deep learning. 

Alternatives:
Dedicated NVIDIA GPUs:
For serious deep learning tasks, consider NVIDIA GPUs like the RTX 3090, RTX 4090, or professional cards like the RTX A6000 or Tesla A100. 

Cloud Platforms:
Utilize cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, which offer powerful NVIDIA GPUs for rent. 
In summary: While the Radeon 680M can handle basic AI tasks, it is not recommended for demanding deep learning workloads due to hardware and software limitations. NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA and cuDNN support are the preferred choice for deep learning.
